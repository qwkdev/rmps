                    <p>Saviour siblings are a child conceived through selective in vitro fertilization as a potential source of donor organs or cells for an existing sibling with a life-threatening medical condition. There is no information on how many saviour siblings there are, but in 2009, (in the UK) parents tried to make a saviour sibling, but ended up with twin saviour siblings.</p>
                    <h1>What are the advantages and disadvantages of saviour siblings?</h1>
                    <p>Saviour siblings help sick family members and make their lives better, which is good. But some people worry that making these siblings might not be fair to the new child. They think it's not right to have a baby just to help someone else. Also, the new sibling might feel stressed or confused about their purpose. Using special techniques to make these siblings could have problems too, like changing genes in ways we don't expect or causing health issues for the new child.</p>
                    <h1>What does Christianity think?</h1>
                    <p>Some Christians argue that savior siblings created to aid sick family members, are morally justified, seeing it as similar to a blood or organ donation and citing Jesus' healing acts. However others (especially those valuing the sanctity of life from conception) raise concerns about the ethical consequences of discarding embryos in the process. They say that children should be valued for being creations of God. Saviour siblings may also be very emotionally damaged when they find out that they were born to help a sick sibling.</p>
                    <h1>What does the Roman Catholic Church think?</h1>
                    <p>The Roman Catholic Church doesn't support IVF or PGD, because you have to throw away embryos, which is murder. Even when it comes to making a Saviour Sibling using PGD, where they pick an embryo that matches a sick sibling, the Roman Catholic Church doesn't like it. They think it's wrong to throw away healthy embryos just because they're not a perfect match. The Church wants to protect every human life, even when it's just starting.</p>
                    <h1>What does Islam think?</h1>
                    <p>In Islam, what people think about savior siblings, where a child is born to help a sick brother or sister, depends on a few things. Firstly, if the main reason for doing it is to save a life, it's seen as okay in Islamic beliefs. Secondly, scholars look at whether the child helping could get hurt and if it's worth it to save the sick sibling. Finally, it's important that how they make this happen follows Islamic values and cares about everyone involved being okay. Although, some Muslims do think that they shouldn't interfere with "Allah's plan" by creating saviour siblings (it's unnatural)</p>
